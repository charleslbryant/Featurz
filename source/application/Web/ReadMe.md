Featurz.Web
===========

This project provides a ASP.Net Web Forms version of the admin. I cut my teeth
in ASP.Net in Web Forms so I wanted to see what I would come up with.

Codebehind
------------

The Codebehind is only used to bind to the ASPX view. All logic for the view is
kept in Model classes. I was going to try some type of MVP with "on change 
events" and the whole 9 yards, but I wanted to keep it simple an approachable
by developers that have no experience with MVP.
