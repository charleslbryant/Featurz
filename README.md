Featurz
=======

Featurz is a .NET feature toggle manager inspired by Togglz for Java. This won't be a line for line port of Togglz, but borrowing code patterns and features from Togglz will drive initial development. I am not even sure if this makes sense in C# yet, I'm just upset that .NET doesn't have something like Togglz to help with Continuous Deployment.
